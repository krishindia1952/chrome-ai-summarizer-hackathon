# 🚀 Project Title: Quick Summary — AI-Powered Chrome Extension

## 📌 Application Description

**Quick Summary** is a lightweight Chrome Extension that helps users instantly summarize selected or pasted text on any webpage using Chrome’s built-in Gemini Nano AI.

Whether you're reading a long article, email, or document, Quick Summary gives you the key points in one click — saving time and improving focus.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This extension is built to use Chrome’s experimental `chrome.ai.summarize()` API, which is currently only available on select devices and Chrome versions (122+). As a result, the summarization feature may not function on all systems yet — but the extension is fully wired and ready for integration once the API becomes publicly available.
